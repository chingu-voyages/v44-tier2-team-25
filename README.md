Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.

* For each modified file we must check the "Viewed" option and, if necessary, add "comments" to each or a single comment before finalizing the review, as in the example below:

### 5 - Click on "Review Changes", add a comment and select "approved" if everything is working or "request change" if something is broken, that's why it's important to run it locally, because the code, despite not displaying errors and conflicts, may have some problem running:

### 6 - after submitting the revision, the user will be notified, and after making the changes, should just commit the update in the same branch and the new commits will be displayed in the same pull request.

* With that, we go back to step 1 until the code is approved and goes to merge.
